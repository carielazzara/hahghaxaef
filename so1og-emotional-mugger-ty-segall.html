Emotional Mugger is the eighth studio album by American garage rock musician Ty Segall, released on January 22, 2016 on Drag City Records. The album was produced by both Segall and F. Bermudez. Ty Segall has always reliably subscribed to rockist orthodoxy, but he's left room enough on his new album for noisy evolution. Jan 13, 2016 · Barreling on after a non-stop flurry of activity over the past eight years, Ty Segall is dropping his 10th solo album in the dead of winter, its cover depicting a Xeroxed baby head as it peers out of the fold amid a field of toner-black gradients. Staring into that disquieting image. Drag City: making records since the second death of "Paul McCartney," also covered up. In it for the music, hoping you will use it.

Emotional Mugger was initially announced when Ty sent VHS tapes of the album to certain media outlets. Some of the tapes also contained various movies in addition to the music.  Each song on Ty Segall's eighth album seems to be an oblique short story about cheap thrills. The album's populated with addicts—people engineered to come back for more despite how shitty it may ultimately make them feel. Segall seems less focused on hitting the exact right notes.

When Funkadelic played what they called "rock music," it was like they'd fallen out of some alternate timeline. Hey everyone, and welcome to today's installment of the Album of the Year series, where the users of /r/indieheads talk about the very best 2016 had to offer.

I submitted this earlier without the 'Let's Discuss', but it was removed for rule #5 so let's try again. I saw Ty Segall and the Muggers the other night and it actually really surprised me. I was expecting the typical album release tour kind of set, about half new stuff mixed in with the old hits. But what they performed was really Emotional Mugger Live, a kind of stage production rock opera kind of thing (with some crowd pleases at the end). The show made me think about certain aspects Ty Segall is at his best when handling his influences roughly, riffing on a fluid but familiar set of styles while heading off into extreme, outlandish new directions. Over the past few years, those influences have shifted gradually while a certain level of looseness has remained. Emotional Mugger is the latest studio album by Ty Segall and was released in January this year. What do you think of it?

Having been a notable figure in the DIY music culture for many years now, Ty Segall returns with his eighth studio album 'Emotional Mugger', and as usual has it draped in the quirky nostalgia his music creates. Not a full month into 2016 an we already have a new Ty Segall album. A major departure from his past efforts, this new one finds Ty on the precipice of psychedelic chaos with a super messy, lo-fi, experimental affair that may divide his fanbase. The layering on these tracks builds an atmosphere of surreal psychedelia which serves the world created within this album's lyrics: there is a concept/story going on--though, admittedly, I haven't quite parsed it yet. We have characters: Candy Ty Segall Emotional Mugger (Drag City) Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. The music that Ty Segall plays is, at least on the surface, not all that complicated. Ty Segall is an american music artist versed in a trashy, garage amp lo-fi rock. His new album, Emotional Mugger, talks about subjects such as vice and corruption in a psychedelic cocaine-fueled rant. This short film by Yoka features heavily edited music from his album, and I had to say even though the presented subject was very grotesque, I found it highly entertaining. Here is a link to the video: https://vimeo.com/153168102 NSFW Hopefully this will bring some discussion on director's.

Metacritic Music Reviews, Emotional Mugger by Ty Segall, The eighth full-length release for the garage rock artist was produced with F Bermudez. So the murlocs attract me because of the overall good feel of the music, "loopholes" is a track that really interests me because of the droney "ahhh" singing etc. "Rolling on" is another good track, all containing really good harmonica similar to king gizzard stuff of course. For graveyard, I like the more bluesy rock like "the siren" and "no good, Mr holden" for the fantastic vocals mixed with powerful riffage. Unknown Mortal Orchestra I know is a little different, but figured I could Ty Segall - Emotional Mugger Prolific rocker's urgency continues to produce thrilling results. Tracklist: 01. Squealer 02.

It should be more exhausting to keep up with Ty Segall. The clip at which the garage-glam savant releases records is on par with the '70s supernatural output of our dear departed friend David Bowie.
