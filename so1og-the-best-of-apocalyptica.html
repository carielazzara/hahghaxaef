I had known and confirmed during this meet and greet that the band was simply pulling one of the pit photographers aside to cover the meet and greet. Worlds Collide. Исполнитель – Apocalyptica.

What is in someone's heart? In the subconscious, your average man today may have past loves around there. His heart may be wrapped. 
I’m sure others do like me, so just thought I’d see what songs other people identify with. I don’t pretend to have great knowledge of or taste in music, so take the songs I identify with as just that, what I identify with. What I find really interesting is I personally think two if not all three of these songs could have/may have been written about toxic romantic relationships, but I see my relationship with my uBPD mom in them.

Advanced Alpha - Review Preface: I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I an audio guru; I do not have “trained” ears so my explanation of sound may be what some consider “simple” or in “layman” terms.

Definitely one of their best, Till Lendemann gives amazing vocals, and while I like their instrumentals better, this is one of those ones where they chose perfect vocals This should. 
Music is something that helped me cope with the various emotions associated with my relationship with my exwBPD. I realised that certain songs really spoke to me at different times- when I had a certain emotion or a certain thought or I needed some strength. So this is a long AF post where I wanted to share some of those. I'm Indian so I've included some non-english stuff too. To each their own. I hope this helps.
