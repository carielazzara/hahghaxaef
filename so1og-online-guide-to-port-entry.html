It works perfectly, via IPv4 and IPv6, both locally and from outside the firewall. Which is great, but also slightly alarms me because I haven't actually done anything to let IPv6 traffic through my Edgerouter 4. In order to get outside IPv4 traffic on port 80 and port 443 to the server, I needed to create a port forwarding rule that sent port 80 and port 443 requests Hey all I made a thread earlier about my £30 New Vegas Tablet > https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/asndo3/discussion\_meet\_my\_30\_new\_vegas\_machine\_a\_cheap/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/asndo3/discussion_meet_my_30_new_vegas_machine_a_cheap/) A lot of the responses I got was from people wanting to know how to set this up for themselves.

Hola, New year, new gaming resolutions! Welcome to 2019 and my first monthly progress report. This one is a lengthy one, so if you're interested, grab a drink of your choice before reading. The reason I've done so well is just plenty of free time, a focus on some short titles, and an eagerness to catch up with gaming after spending so much of Christmas period celebrating with family where my gaming time was severely limited! But anyway, on with the report, first things first though:. Received my iota order today with several sensors/devices and thought I would provide a review for anyone interested. I've highlighted the issues or critiques I have in bold. TLDR: If you've used Abode before, iota will be very familiar as it is essentially the previous gateway with an integrated camera, motion sensor, wifi and Z-wave Plus.

Crossposting from /r/zerotier \-- hope that is okay. I'm tearing my hair out trying to determine what's wrong and how to troubleshoot this, and would be EXTREMELY grateful for any ideas as I'm only somewhat savvy with Linux and networking: I have two remote LANs that I'm trying to bridge over a ZeroTier virtual network by using a Raspberry Pi as the bridging device at each location.
